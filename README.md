# 🌌 XR Home Chat

**XR Home Chat** is an experimental **A-Frame VR/AR app** with an integrated **OpenAI chatbot and voice assistant**.
You can type or speak to the AI inside a 3D environment — and it answers right on your floating panel in VR. ✨

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Immersive A-Frame Scene** — clean, minimalist 3D panel for conversations.
* **Text Chat** — powered by OpenAI’s `Responses API` with **streaming SSE output**.
* **Voice Chat** — WebRTC + OpenAI **Realtime API** (ephemeral tokens).
* **Edge Functions** — serverless routes (`/api/chat`, `/api/realtime-token`, `/api/health`) deployed on **Vercel Edge Runtime**.
* **Strict but Flexible CSP** — lets A-Frame and WebRTC run safely.
* **One-click deploy** to Vercel.

## ⚡ Deployment (Vercel)

1. Push this repo to **GitHub**.
2. Import it into **Vercel**.
3. Add Environment Variables (**Settings → Environment Variables**) for both **Preview** and **Production**:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY       = sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   OPENAI_MODEL_TEXT    = gpt-4o-mini
   OPENAI_MODEL_REALTIME= gpt-4o-realtime-preview
   ```
4. Redeploy.
5. Visit:

   * `/` → VR scene with floating chat panel
   * `/api/health` → shows env status (handy debug)

---

## 🎤 Usage

* **Type:** enter a message in the input box and hit **Send**.
* **Speak:** click 🎤 to start a voice session — the model responds with **live audio**.

---

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

* **401 invalid\_api\_key** → Check your OpenAI key. Must be a **Project API Key** from the project with billing enabled.
* **404 on /api/** → Ensure the `api/` folder is at the repo root.
* **CSP errors** → The included `vercel.json` loosens restrictions for A-Frame & WebRTC.

## 🌟 Inspiration

This project combines:

* [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) for 3D + WebXR
* [OpenAI Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/responses) for streaming text
* [OpenAI Realtime API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime) for voice chat

Built as a **sandbox** to explore conversational XR experiences. 🚀
